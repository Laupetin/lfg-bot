Discord  Bot for event managing and looking for group.  
This simple bot will let you set up separate lfg channel, and then send event messages to show that you are looking for a group. Several lfg channels are supported as well.
All messages, which are not commands from [existing commands list](#existing-commands) will be deleted immediately (configurable, see commands).  
Commands will be deleted right after processing.  
To accept or decline event, a user can click on üëç or üëé emoji respectively.  
All other reactions will be deleted to prevent reaction spam and trolling (configurable, see commands).  

## Existing commands
**NB:** due to changes in the Discord's policies, all commands were changed to slash commands.
List of available commands:
- `/help` - get info about bot and list of existing commands
- `/setup` - make this channel an lfg channel. Requires user to have 'Manage Channels' permission.
- `/moderate [True/False] #{channel}` - Enable/disable moderation of the lfg channels. If moderation is enabled on LFG channel, the bot will delete every message exept event and will delete emotions exept predefined ones. Requires user to have admin/owner rights or permissions to manage channels.
- `/create` - add lfg message to the lfg channel. The command will create form, where the user will be prompted to complete the survey. User's answers will be collected into an embed and sent to the lfg channel. Works only in lfg channels.
- `/ping` - Writes alive and waiting for your commands in the chat if the bot is working.This command is created to check if the bot is alive.

## If you found a bug
If you have any issue with the bot functionality, feel free to post an issue in this repo - for now, I am intended to maintain this app as long as I don't feel it is stable enough.

## Need any adjustments?
If you feel some cool feature is missing, or you want to make some minor tweaks just for your quality of life - feel free to either post an issue in the repo or make a fork and adjust it yourself as you see fit.  
Please bear in mind: I intend to leave this bot single-purpose, meaning I won't add features which are not related to the idea of managing lfg channels.
